# Wex : Python weather extractor :earth_americas::sun_with_face::cloud:

Weather Extractor(Wex) is a python library to extract weather data from a string. Wex searches for a city name in a string
and gets you the current weather conditions.

Let's predend you live in New York and you want to know the weather in London. You can simply so this by checking your phone, or just 
Google it. But, it takes some time to launch the browser and enter your query and same with the phone. Why don't you write a simple python script to know the current weather. All you have to do is the following code. And It show's you the weather.

Wex is not built for a simple task like this. It's built for a WeatherBot. A WeatherBot can figure out what the text says.Wex is built to make it easier for people to build weatherbots which can get the weather.

##Usage

```python

from Extractor import Wex

weather = Wex.WexWeather("Whats the weather in London?","[API-Key]")

print(weather.WexGetWeather())
            
```

##Output
> ("Clouds","1.15")
