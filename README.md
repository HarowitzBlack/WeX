# WeX : A python weather extractor :earth_americas::sun_with_face::cloud:

*Have you ever wanted to know, the current weather of a place, from a city name in a string? 
I guess you have thought of it some time in your life. :umbrella: :sunny: :snowman:

Well, WeX does that for you :)

WeX reads a string and looks for a city name, then it gives the current weather conditions of the city.*

## Documentation will be added :page_facing_up::bell::book:

**_What does it do?_**
    
    // This is the input
    >> What is the weather in London?
    
    // This is the output
    .. It's Clouds in London with 1.15C

    
**_How does it work?_**:wrench::nut_and_bolt:
-----------------
            #import the Wex module
            
            from Extractor import Wex
            from Extractor.Wex import FormatWeatherConditions
            
            weather = Wex.WexWeather("Whats the weather in London?","[API-Key]")
            
            data = weather.WexGetWeather()
            
            weather = FormatWeatherConditions(data)
            
            print(weather)
 
_That's it. Just tiny bit of code to get the current weather of London.:memo:
